This is a ComfyUI node that processes your input text with the Unprompted templating language. Early alpha release.

Please refer to the [main Unprompted repository](https://github.com/ThereforeGames/unprompted) for more information. Detailed documentation is available there. Thank you!

> ⚠️ **Note:** Some shortcodes were specifically designed for use with the Automatic1111 WebUI and are not compatible with this ComfyUI node. This node is primarily intended for text-based operations such as wildcards.
